### New dataset — Kotlin/JS vs Kotlin/Wasm (with totals and per-iteration averages)

The table below uses the second set of logs you shared. For each test we compute:
- Mean total time per pass (ms) — the average of the reported totals across 5 runs.
- Mean per-iteration time — the average of the reported per-iteration values across 5 runs, displayed in appropriate units.

Pass sizes in this dataset:
- AnimationFrame: 20 frames
- setTimeout: 20 calls
- AwaitPromise: 10,000 awaits
- ImmediateContinuation: 100,000 ops
- Loop: 100,000,000 iterations (avg in the raw logs was shown as `0s` due to rounding; we compute and show ns/op here)
